# projectEuler
Some of my solutions for project Euler using c#

Note: This repository was mainly made for fun. It will only contain the project Euler problems from 1 to 100 which in one way or another are widely available and not banned from providing on the internet.

I chose c# because I like the aesthetics that VS provides. To run it, you will need the folder 'Methods' and selected problems you want. 

I focus on coding it the with most cleanliness I can. Project contains all reusable code in the folder 'Methods'.

I tried expanding the use-case whenever possible, so not only it solves problem using the given number, but the user can input his own number to be calculated.
